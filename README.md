**It will reveal itself when you are worthy...**

**Specter-Rift** is a fictional in-game programming language designed for advanced players to build their own hacking tools in a dystopian game world. This language is used on the **ghOSt** operating system, where elite players can dive deep into hacking and code manipulation. 

Do you have what it takes to hack your way through the game's layers? Can you master **Rift** and use it to break through the virtual barriers of the ghOSt OS? Only the truly worthy will unlock its secrets.

## What is Rift?

**Rift** is the language that powers hacking in the game world of **Specter**. It allows players to interact with the game‚Äôs virtual operating system, **ghOSt**, enabling them to build custom tools, perform advanced interactions, and explore the deepest corners of the game. It‚Äôs not for the faint of heart‚Äîonly the most advanced users will survive.

This language is built using **ANTLR** (Another Tool for Language Recognition), a powerful framework for building languages. The goal of **Specter-Rift** is to create a powerful, user-friendly language with a syntax that‚Äôs simple enough for new players to pick up but deep enough for advanced users to find real creative power. The core components of **Rift** include:

- **Syntax** that‚Äôs easy to read and understand for basic users
- **Advanced functionality** for expert players to push the limits
- **In-game tools** that allow you to create custom tools to hack the system

## Why Open Source?

This project is open-source for fun and exploration. **Specter-Rift** allows anyone to experiment with an actual programming language, build custom extensions, and explore the magic of game hacking. 

I‚Äôm sharing this with the world as part of my game‚Äôs early marketing strategy. I want curious minds to learn from the source code, explore the language, and maybe even find clues to **Rift‚Äôs** deeper secrets hidden throughout the codebase. It‚Äôs a puzzle in plain sight‚Äîare you clever enough to solve it?
